# Mission Reports
* Covers writeups for RPG sessions. The exact format can be anything, but should not be a fictional account unconnected to an RPG session
  * When adding a new History Report, create a folder starting with MR and the date. For example, *MR20190113-Some-Title*. The point of the new folder is in case the report is not simply a text file. HTML files are also acceptable and need an *images* subfolder
  * In that folder, put the report, with the same name as the folder. For example, a folder with the name *MR20190113-Some-Title* should have a file within named *MR20190113-Some-Title.txt*. 
  * If there are multiple files in the folder, there should be further enumeration. For example, *MR20190113-Some-Title-01.txt* and *MR20190113-Some-Title-02.txt*
  * HTML files with images should have an associated *images* subfolder with the images inside. Images should not be at the same level as the HTML files
  * Files should be in *txt* or *html* formats
  * If a file is still being edited and not yet ready for publishing, put a *DRAFT.txt* file in the folder at the same level as the text or HTML file explaining that the document is not yet finished.
