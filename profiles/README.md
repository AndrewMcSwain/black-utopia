# Profiles
This folder holds various types of profiles for creatures, organizations and things:

* Entity Profiles
  * Found in the *profiles/entity-profiles* folder
  * Covers writeups for characters, AI personalities, animals, or any generally autonomous being or class of beings
  * When adding a new Entity Profile, create a folder starting with EP and the date. For example, *EP20190113-Some-Title*. The point of the new folder is in case the report is not simply a text file. HTML files are also acceptable and need an *images* subfolder
  * In that folder, put the report, with the same name as the folder. For example, a folder with the name *EP20190113-Some-Title* should have a file within named *EP20190113-Some-Title.txt*. 
  * If there are multiple files in the folder, there should be further enumeration. For example, *EP20190113-Some-Title-01.txt* and *EP20190113-Some-Title-02.txt*
  * HTML files with images should have an associated *images* subfolder with the images inside. Images should not be at the same level as the HTML files
  * Files should be in *txt* or *html* formats
  * If a file is still being edited and not yet ready for publishing, put a *DRAFT.txt* file in the folder at the same level as the text or HTML file explaining that the document is not yet finished.

* Organization Profiles
  * Found in the *profiles/org-profiles* folder
  * Covers writeups for organizations such as corporations, governments, religious organizations, gangs and so forth.
  * When adding a new Organization Profile, create a folder starting with ORGP and the date. For example, *ORGP20190113-Some-Title*. The point of the new folder is in case the report is not simply a text file. HTML files are also acceptable and need an *images* subfolder
  * In that folder, put the report, with the same name as the folder. For example, a folder with the name *ORGP20190113-Some-Title* should have a file within named *ORGP20190113-Some-Title.txt*.
