	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>This document is for use in writing History Reports for the Black Utopia project. It will be periodically updated and provides details on a world environment that can be used as a basis for any work associated with this project. Depending on how useful this document is, it may be revised as time goes on to better adapt to the needs of those who contribute to the project.</p>
	<h1>World Overview</h1>
	<p>Black Utopia is a cyberpunk dystopia where the world is covered with cities, largely run by corporations, both in terms of allies and competition. These corporations, through a variety of covert and over means, control the various levels of government, populating offices with either sycophants or incompetent politicians. Mass media is used as a control vector, providing distractions as well as influencing opinion. All devices track their users to the most minute degree. This eradicates privacy, but it is not noticed by a population distracted by entertainment and manufactured scandals and events.</p>
	<p>In addition, artificial intelligence has a massive unseen impact on daily life, influencing the flow of products and regulating behaviors of the population from the behind-the-scenes. In addition, rogue A.I. attempt to fulfill their own unguessable goals by hiding within the world networks and engaging in rogue manipulation of events as they see fit.</p>
	<p>Finally, rogue organizations hide within the population, attempting to subvert the existing government and even the society at large to achieve their interests.</p>
	<h1>Cultural Aspects</h1>
	<h3>General Culture</h3>
	<p>Society is remniscent of a high-tech version of the film of <em>Idiocracy</em>. The populace is educated enough to engage in work, but schooling has driven the interest in learning out of most of the citizens. The economy is stagnant, with periodic fits and starts that are used by the powers that be to declare a limitless economy. In fact, wages are low and prices are high. The high costs also preventing investments in infrastructure outside of certain privileged areas. Finally, the lack of interest in politics has allowed and corporate influence in general has flooded the government with corrupt politicians, complicating matters further.</p>
	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>Technology has infused every possible area of life, making it both ubiquitous and invisible. People, pets and plants are tagged and tracked, their data used to control as many aspects of their lives as possible. As an example, it is no longer possible to simply purchase things; they are licensed or leased. Licensing a refrigerator for the home influences buying habits because the refrigerator company may also have a food division. Therefore, placing non-compliant food packages may result in a fine, a warning, or perhaps even arrest. Automated machine learning systems track people throughout the day, analyzing behaviors and physical chemical levels to determine mindset and how best to influence that mindset with non-optional, customized advertisements, warnings and uninvited distractions or propaganda. The only way around this is to purchase black-market products, much of which have been altered to prevent surveillance. There is, however, a high price to pay if contraband is found.</p>
	<p>The oppression of technology has caused a popular backlash; an interest in mysticism. Technological expertise, and expertise in general, is shunned in favor of belief in the supernatural, &#x0201C;Quantum Healing&#x0201D;, idols, dieties, and so on. This has reached the point where ancient vocabulary is being used to describe modern things. For example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Tulpas</em> refer to artificial intelligence</li>
		<li><em>Golems</em> refer to androids or robots in general</li>
		<li><em>Sprites or Fairies</em> refer to drones or non-autonomous machines of a generally small size</li>
		<li><em>Spells</em> refers to source code or any programming ability, technological, biological or otherwise</li>
		<li><em>Homonculus</em> refers to genetically-engineered humans (although not normal humans that have been genetically modified)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
	<p>Law enforcement draws its ranks from citizens tired of living a powerless life. Almost no one actually believes in the idea of public service. For the most part it is a way to get employment, achieve some level of power in life and get revenge on others under the guise of authority. Police action is a constant factor of life and reminiscent of the early days of New York when politicians and wealthy families would provide material support to local gangs in exchange for muscle work. For the most part, what passes as law enforcement is actually a combination of mercenaries or paramilitary groups owned by the corporations through channels in the state, or wealthy families protecting themselves and enforcing their will through a private army.</p>
	<h3>Entertainment</h3>
	<p>The vast majority of celebrities are computer-generated characters created by autonomous calculations made from data collected from the population. The storylines, personal lives, social media presence and other aspects of these characters are fabricated autonomously as well. The productions they appear in, whether it is a play, a video, or a musical, are based on cookie-cutter templates that are just high-energy and frenetic enough that the general population does not notice. Any critique or review of these productions are artificially generated as well. Public appearances or live performances are usually handled by life-like androids and holograms</p>
	<p>There are often underground entertainment and news-related productions that are made, but these are unlicensed and therefore illegal. Further, due to the total surveillance of the population, these productions do not last long and cannot use the network to reach too many people before it is shut down. If the storylines are popular, the stories are added to the list of story templates. If a performer is popular, the performer is quietly executed and then the physical features are recorded into the computers and mixed into the list of virtual celebrities. If a song is popular, the songwriters are quietly forced to write more songs, just as quietly executed and the songs are then added to template of music to auto-generate. Live performers for just about anything are generally under the protection of someone with power and about as easily discarded as one might imagine.</p>
	<h3>Environment</h3>
	<p>Pollution is rampant, thanks to decaying infrastructure. Depending on the segment of the population, the pollution has caused multiple medical issues, including reduced intelligence, birth defects, cancer, mutations and other issues. The most heavily affected segments of the population are often the poorest and therefore the most ignored.</p>
	<p>Most natural things do not exist any more. Most animals are either robots or genetically grown in a lab. Even the sky is artificial, to keep out toxic rain and massive storms that pummel the Earth outside the great city-buildingis where everyone dwells. Any foliage is generally fake in some respect and everywhere one would look there are buildings, pipes, auto-driving vehicles and other oppressive examples of technology run amok.</p>
	<h3>The Workplace</h3>
	<p>To control the workers and create a more efficient workforce, behaviors of employees are controlled. For the most part, everything is pared down to the minimum behavior set needed for interaction. To keep things as &#x0201C;positive&#x0201D; as possible, all employees are required to smile, speak pleasantly at all times and use only the pre-determined, non-offensive, morally and demographically neutral vocabulary. This changes slightly from company to company and department to department, so frequent re-reading of the behavioral best-practices manual is necessary.</p>
	<p>Drug use in one form or another is rampant in the workplace for a variety of reasons. First, there is the need to perform and make numbers, second is the stress of keeping up proper behaviors and appearances and finally, abuse and corruption is simply rampant for those who know how to work the system. Backstabbing is common, so political alliances and betrayals are just as common. Teams and departments operate as small fiefdoms and there is constant battle for resources.</p>
	<p>As employees gain power, the ability to break the rules becomes more overt, to the point where executives are able to behave in ways that would get any employee fired and do so in full view of everyone else. Executives often leverage this power by playing employees against each other for entertainment and strategy against other executives. Often, executives will also make deals through intermediaries with local gangs so that the gangs may act as muscle for the executive's interest. The more well-placed executives may just hire a private mercenary group or work through various shady organizations for contract work.</p>
	<h3>Civil Rights</h3>
	<p>Although much lip service is made, there basically is none. All the old prejudices and abuses still exist, but with one extra wrinkle: genetically engineered beings. Despite the vast and ubiquitous use of automation, the size of the population is such that living people are still needed for a variety of mundane tasks. Given the scale required, the most efficient way to handles things is through a slave labor system. Thus, living being created in a lab, be they human, plant or animal, are not legally (and as a result socially) considered living beings. Instead, they are considered property that can be used as seen fit. This effectively makes some of the most intelligent, powerful and resilient beings live at the lowest level of social hierarchy. Even mystics, who have eschewed technology for the natural world do not view genetically-engineered entities as truly real, but rather a mockery of the real thing. With this level of social and legal prejudice, genetically-engineered beings may run the gamut of being treated well or treated horrifically, but never treated as peers worthy of free choice. Most are used for labor, some for leisure and many for cannon fodder. Abuse is frequent, but not considered actual violence due to the status of engineered beings. Thanks to the totalitarian nature of the world, organized revolt is difficult, although many underground and rogue organizations find a way to get some of these beings within their ranks. That said, it is just switching one abusive master for another as few will treat such creatures as truly equal.</p>
	<h1>The System</h1>
	<p>The world of Black Utopia might be thought of as one gigantic system that no one fully understands. Everyone exists within the system and no single entity can know the whole system. The system is composed of autonomous parts that try to control other parts of the system, but only manage to reinforce the system as a whole by doing so. The system can only be affected by something outside of itself. If anything does exist outside the system, those within the sytem cannot reach it because the system is itself very insular and jealous of the things that comprise it. </p>
	<p>The system is almost Lovecraftian in that it is like Azathoth, Lovecraft's mindless god that affects the universe without thought or reason. It is an amalgamation of all its various subsystems, but with no other organizing factor or intelligence behind it. No one &#x201C;beats&#x201D; the system. One can only benefit from it for a certain period of time due to the ebbs and flows of circumstance and luck. Eventually, all destinies are determined by the system. This is the world of Black Utopia.</p>
